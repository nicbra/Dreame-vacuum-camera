# Dreame vacuum cleaner camera streamer

This is the code to stream from the inbuilt camera in the Dreame vacuum cleaner. It is only being tested with the Dreame D10s Pro with Valetudo.

Building:

The convient shell script `run_docker.sh` builds a docker container (if not already built),
and build the application.
